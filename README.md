OpenBACH
========

OpenBACH is a testbed able to control multiple network entity and collect date from them. It is composed of one controller, one collector and multiple agents. The controller controls the agents and can launch jobs into them. The collector will then collecte the results.

Design Principles
=================

   * The controller can launch several pre-coded jobs (ping, iperf, rate monitoring) on the remote agents
   * The user can code new jobs, install them on the agents and launch them with the controller
   * OpenBACH provides web interfaces to visualize the results and the logs of the simulations (using Grafana and Kibana)
