This Job measures the rate of a flow. It uses an Iptable entry to measure the number of packets and the size of data.

Required Arguments:
  interval : it is the interval of time the Job will measure the rate
  chain : it is the Iptable chain used to choose if a packet should be consider in the measure (same synthax as Iptable)
  
Statistics: it only produces one statistic. The name of the stats is 'rate_monitoring'. The only value there is in the stats is named 'rate' and is produced every *interval*
