== Context of OpenBACH
The objective of this study is to design and implement a benchmark for performing tests and collect different metrologies
to allow the evaluation of next proposed transport protocols and mechanisms on a terrestrial, satellite and hybrid network.
It is important to implement an adequate measurement environment to provide an appropriate evaluation framework.

The transport benchmark would be able to quickly benefit different actors for the development of satellite network
and telecom technologies, but also the actors of terrestrial networks, which would allow to extend the number of potential users.

This benchmark must propose to integrate existing metrology tools, or exceptionally developed according to specific
needs. It must be easily operated and at the same time deliver a maximum of useful information for the understanding,
the validation and the design of existing or under development transport mechanisms. The benchmark shall also be capable
of analyzing the deployment of protocols and the options supported on clients or remote servers. In addition, different
visualizations tools and statistical analysis shall be proposed. Moreover, tools allowing to configure the network must
be implemented in order to facilitate the implementation of exhaustive testing, reproducible or even automated. Traffic
injection or traffic generation will also be deployed within the benchmark.

The test bed will be developed in an open source logic similar to the one used for OpenSAND. The components will eventually
be interfaced and / or integrate OpenSAND, in a logic that will be jointly defined by CNES, Thales Alenia Space, and Viveris
Technologies at the end of the study.


== Generic use case of OpenBACH

The objective of this project is thus to create a benchmark allowing a user to perform a set of actions presented in
<<img-generic_use_case>>. These actions are grouped in 4 different phases:
{nbsp} +
[#img-generic_use_case,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Generic use case of OpenBACH
image::generic_use_case.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

*	*Phase 1*: Installation/deployment
**	In this phase, a user would wish to perform and easy and straightforward installation/deployment of any tool and/or
software that he needs in order to evaluate a network under test. That includes the installation of OpenBACH itself.

*	*Phase 2*: Preparation of scenarios and launch tests
**	In particular, the user would wish to configure all software/tool and entities under evaluation (including OS parameters,
IP, TCP stack, etc), and
**	Schedule and launch all the required tasks/software/tools for evaluating protocols, mechanisms in the network under test.
That might include traffic generators, the launch of measures acquisition.

*	*Phase 3*: Monitoring
**	The user would wish to verify that the tests are correctly running by checking the status of all entities under test, tools,
running software and/or tasks (via logs and status values), and
**	Collect the measures that have been scheduled in the previous phase and visualize real-time results.

*	*Phase 4*: Results analysis
**	Once the tests are finished, the user may wish to perform post-processing actions according to the user needs. In this phase
the user shall be able to perfom from simple actions such as shaping the obtained results (obtain averages/max/min) or more complex
 actions such as computing new results from using different inputs measures.
**	Finally, the user shall be able to visualize this new results and stock them (i.e. images, tables, etc) for creating reports
of the study that has been carried out.

OpenBACH is designed in order to be capable of fulfilling the needs of a user that wishes to perform any of the actions detailed above.



== Functional design


[[section-term, Terminology]]

=== Terminology of OpenBACH

=== Design components

OpenBACH shall implement the components Controller, Collector, Auditorium and different Agents. Their roles are detailed next:

*	A Controller shall centralize and deploy the configuration functionalities of OpenBACH as well as the jobs/scenarios to be
launched.
*	The Collector shall be able to collect all the statistics, data, logs/errors and other messages requested for supervising
the benchmark in a centralized way.
*	The Agents shall be deployed in the different end network entities (work stations, terminals, etc.), middle entities
(server, proxy, etc.) that are supposed to be controlled by OpenBACH, or even in the same entities where the Controller
and Collector are deployed. The Agents shall control (schedule/launch/stop) the jobs within a network entity according to
the Controller commands, and collect the local stats/logs sent by these jobs. As we will see, an Agent might be placed next
to the Collector and/or the Controller.
* The Auditorium component shall centralize the different frontend interfaces for configuring and monitoring (logs and
statistics) the benchmark.

A basic functional scheme of OpenBACH is represented in <<img-basic_funct_design>>. From the Auditorium, a user shall be
able to configure OpenBACH and request information of it (status of entities and components). The configuration is centralized
at the Controller, which is in charge of deploying this configuration to the required Agents (the configuration might also
include the deployment of new Agents and Jobs) and asking for status information. The Agents execute/schedule/stop the Jobs
and relay the informations to be collected (statistics/logs/status) to the Collector, which centralizes all the data from
all the available Agents/Jobs. Once the information is stocked in the Collector, the Controller is able to perform requests
of data regarding the status of OpenBACH (in order to be sent to the Auditorium), and the Auditorium is able to make requests
logs and statistics in order to allow the visualization in the user PC screen.

image::basic_funct_design.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

===	Functional definitions
===	Functionality groups

OpenBACH shall propose two main functionalities: the configuration of the benchmark (including the available jobs) and the
collection of relevant data.

These two types of functionalities are well identified by color in the architecture shown in <<img-funct_design>> :
•	Configuration (purple boxes/arrows): includes configuration of jobs, scenarios, entities, scheduling of jobs/scenarios.
•	Collection and display of statistics and logs/status (blue boxes/arrows) allowing to monitor the Network under Test.


[[section-func_blocks, Functional blocks per component]]
====	Functional blocks per component
Below, we list the functional blocks per component as well as the types of data flows between them that OpenBACH shall
implement. The functional architecture is shown in <<img-funct_design>>.

[#img-funct_design,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Design of OpenBACH components
image::funct_design.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

The Auditorium shall implement several frontends, one per type of display:

*	Two frontends for the configuration of OpenBACH:
**	Web interface-based: a user web interface allowing to configure and schedule the available Jobs/scenarios
of OpenBACH
**	Python scripts-based: allowing also to configure/schedule the available Jobs on each Agent from a Linux shell
terminal. The access to this frontends demands advanced users rights.

*	Two frontends (web interface-based) for displaying real-time data:

**	A dashboard frontend for log messages allowing to get, filter and show the collected logs of the benchmark.
**	A dashboard frontend for real-time statistics allowing to display the collected metrics.
*	A frontend for plotting offline and post-processed data (web interface-based).

The Controller shall implement:

*	A backend: a web server allowing to listen for user interface requests (from frontend) regarding the deployment,
 the configuration and the scheduling of OpenBACH (i.e. Agents, Jobs, Jobs instances, scenarios and scenarios instances),
as well as requests regarding OpenBACH information and status from Agents. These requests are performed using the
“openbach-functions”. The Backend might be able to process itself some of the “openbach-functions” regarding information
of Agents/Jobs, other “openbach-functions” need an action from the Agent side (configure/launch a Job instance, send
updated information/status, etc.). In the latter case, the Backend shall use a daemon called openbach-conductor (see below).
*	A daemon (openbach-conductor): it is in charge of taking the demands of the Backend (under the form of “openbach-functions”),
and communicate them to the Agent by means of Ansible (SSH).

The Agent shall implement:

*	A Control-Agent: It shall be able to configure and execute/schedule/stop different Job instances depending on the Controller
commands (openbach-functions). It also shall be able to get status/information of the Agent itself and the available Jobs, as
well as the Job instances status.
*	A Collect-Agent: it shall allow to collect statistics/data and logs from the different running Job instances of the Agent and
relay them to the Collector and locally store them. It also shall be able to send the status/information obtained by the
Control-Agent.
*	Job instances: One or several executions of a Job configured with a set of parameters. A job instance might be able to perform
different tasks and/or to collect statistics to be sent. They might be started/stopped (e.g. start/stop a ping), activated/deactivated
(e.g. iptables rules), etc. Different types of Jobs are differentiated within OpenBACH depending on the tasks that performs, such
as administration tasks or telecom/network related tasks.

The Collector shall implement:

*	A stats collector daemon: it shall centralize the data/statistics collection received from the Agents and store them into data
storages.
*	A logs collector: it shall centralize the log messages collection received from the Agents and store them into data storages.


=== OpenBACH-functions, Jobs and scenarios (and instances)

The comprehension of these main terms is one of the keys to well understand the OpenBACH design described herein and in particular,
the way to configure the benchmark.

Besides the definition of each term (see Table 3 at the beginning of section <<section-term>>), the purpose of this section is to explain the
relationship between this terms.

As it has been previously explained, the Jobs are the groups of tasks (under the form of scripts) that are deployed in the Agents.
An execution of this script configured with a set of parameters is known as a Job instance (a process launched by the Agent in the
same machine). The jobs instances are scheduled with in a scenario instance and by means of the openbach-functions (ofunc). However,
not all openbach-functions aim at perfoming tasks regarding the job instances; some are related to the installation of Agents, Jobs, etc.

From the controller point of view (<<img-dev_controller>>), the Controller owns the openbach-function (identified by a type and a name),
different scenarios (identified by his name, and allowing to specify different variables) and a scheduler. The scenario owns a group of
ordered openbach-functions (identified by a position id). This openbach-function might own "wait_for" elements, which are able to add
execution dependencies to the openbach-function (i.e. the openbach-function will be launched only when a specific openbach-function
instance has been launched or when a specific job instance has finished).

The scenario instance is defined as a scenario with a date and an id, and it is composed of :

* a group of scheduled openbach-functions instances, which are defined as the ordered openbach-function with all the required arguments
and a date (equal to the date of the scenario plus the offset).
* one/or more "while instances" allowing to implement the "wait_for" elements.  The while must keep sleeping while the out conditions allowing to execute
a specific (or a group of) openbach-function instance is not fulfilled.

The scheduler of the Controller is in charge of launching the scenario instance with all the openbach-function instances.

[#img-dev_controller,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Relationship between scenario instances and openbach-functions in the Controller
image::uml_dev_controller.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

From the Agent point of view (<<img-agent_dev>>), the controller owns also a scheduler, the Jobs that are installed in the Agent,
defined by a job name and a description of the job. The scheduler is in charge of launching the Job instances, which are defined
as the Jobs with a date of execution, an id and the arguments. Finally, each Job instance shall be associated to a scenario instance
context represented by an id.

[#img-agent_dev,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Organisation of Jobs ans Job instances in the Agent
image::uml_agent_dev.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

The steps that shall be performed to schedule and launch the job instance by means of the scenario and the openbach-functions are
described below and represented in <<img-chain_sce>>.

[#img-chain_sce,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Steps to launch a Job instance via the scenario and the openbach-functions concepts
image::chain_scenario.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

1.	(action 1) A user choses to launch a scenario instance from the web browser (web HMI) or the shell terminal (scripts).
The request shall thus be sent via the configuration frontends (action 2). For that, the scenario shall be already created
by the user and available in the backend data base.
2.	(action 3-4) The configuration frontend shall send a request to the backend for launching the scenario instance (via HTTP).
3.	(action 5-6) The backend shall transfer to the openbach-conductor the order of launching the openbach-function to start the scenario
instance.
4. (action 7) When the scenario instance is launched, the openbach-function instances that are defined within the scenario shall be
launched/scheduled by the openbach-conductor. Some of them might imply performing tasks in the Agent, and others in the backend
(e.g. install an Agent). In fact,the openbach-functions shall specify when to launch the job instance in the Agent with respect
to a “reference starting time” of the scenario instance plus an increment delta/offset (∆)
5.	(action 8-9) (if at least one of these functions specifies to perform a task in the Agent) The openbach-conductor shall send the order
to the Agent via Ansible.
6.	(action 10-11) The Agent shall schedule the job instance when it receives the order of scheduling the job instance from
the Controller (openbach-conductor).
7.	(actions 12) The launch of the Job instance is performed by the scheduler of the Control-Agent (when time = “reference
starting time” + ∆, i.e. a “reference starting time” of the scenario instance plus an increment (∆) parameter).

The “reference starting time” of a scenario instance is the time at which the scenario instance shall be launched in the backend.

====	Functional definitions of a Scenario/Scenario instance
The scenario instance is managed by the backend in the Controller and centralizes the status of all the job instances received
from Agents through the Collector and the status of other openbach-functions (ofunc) (e.g. install job/agent). The states of a scenario instance are described below (see <<img-states_sce>>, where highlighted in black we detail the states in normal conditions and in blue those states that are used when external actions (stop/unschedule from user) or errors happen):

*	*scheduling*: when a user decides to launch a scenario, the Controller starts scheduling locally some ofunc and deploying all
the commands (via the openbach-functions)  to the different Agents.
*	*scheduled*: when the Controller receives the ok status from all Agents involved in the scenario instance and he has been able
to schedule its own ofunc. It means also that all jobs instance (job-i) have been correctly scheduled in the Agents.
*	*scheduling error*: if one of the Agents has not been able to schedule a job instance or the Controller has not been able to
schedule an ofunc, the backend will then unschedule all the job instances in all the Agents and the ofunc.
*	*unscheduling*: this state is used when the scenario instance must be unscheduled, either because a scheduling error occurred
or because once everything is scheduled (state “scheduded”), the user decides to unschedule the scenario instance.
*	*unscheduling out of control*: when at least one of the job instances or openbach-function was not correctly unscheduled (e.g.
because the agent does not respond; etc.). In that case, OpenBACH is not able to recover the control of the scenario instance and
it activates a flag “out of control” and continues with the scenario instance until it is finished (all job instances finished).
At this point, the user could manually restart the machines/agents or kill the desired job instances processes.
*	*unscheduled*: if all job instances and ofunc where successfully unscheduled. The scenario instance is considered over and suppressed.
*	*running*: a scenario instance is considered in this state when at least one of the job-i/ofunc is still running. It keeps
running while all job-i/ofunc and the Agents send an ok/running status, or if the user decides to stop it, or if the end time
is reached.
*	*running error*: when one Agent or a job-i/ofunc send an error status. If the error is considered not critical, the scenario
might keep running. If it is considered critical, the scenario instance should go to the “stopping” state.
*	*stopping*: in this state, the backend tries to stop the scenario instance (and thus all job-i/ofunc running/scheduled).
*	*stopping out of control*: similarly to the case of “unscheduling out of control”, this means that the backend was not able
to stop everything. It then activates the flag ‘out of control” and comes back to the “run” state until the scenario instance
is finished.
*	*finished*: when the end time of the scenario instance is reached with the flag out of control not activated, meaning the
scenario instance is correctly finished.
*	*finished error*: when the end time of the scenario instance if reached with the flag out of control activated, meaning
there has been a problem.

====	Functional definitions of a Job/Job instance
The job instance is managed by the Agent. The states of a Job instance (job-i) are described below (<<img-states_job>>):

* *scheduling*: when the order from the Controller is received, the Agent schedules the job-i.
* *scheduled*: when a job-i has been correctly scheduled in the Agent.
* *scheduling error*: if the Agent have not been able to schedule the job instance, it should send a nok to the Controller.
* *unscheduling*: this state is used when the job-i must be unscheduled because an order from the Controller is received to
do so.
* *unscheduling out of control*: when the job-i was not correctly unscheduled. In that case, OpenBACH is not able to recover
the control of the job instance and it activates a flag “out of control” and goes back to the state “running” until it is
finished. At this point, the user could manually restart the machines/agent or kill the job instances.
* *unscheduled*: if the job instance was successfully unscheduled. The job-i is considered over and suppressed.
* *execution*: when the launch time of the job-i is reached. Depending on the type of the job (persistent or not persistent),
the next state is “run” or “finished”.
* *running*: when a job is of the type persistent, it keeps running until a stop is scheduled, or if the end time is reached.
* *execution error*: when a job-i has not been correctly executed.
* *running error*: when the job-i gets an error exception. If the error is considered not critical, the job-i might keep
running. It is considered critical, the job-i should go to the “stopping” state. The way to treat the errors is carried out
by the job-I itself. Therefore, a correct treatment of the errors shall be performed when developing jobs.
* *stopping*: in this state, either the job-i tries to stop itself or it is stopped by the Agent (e.g.: if a stop order is
scheduled or reveived from the Controller)
* *stopping out of control*: similarly to the case of “unscheduling out of control”, this means that the end or the job-i
itself were not able to stop the job-i. It then activates the flag “out of control” and comes back to the “run” state until
the job-i is finished.
* *finished*: when the end time of the job-i is reached or it is stopped.

=====	Job types
NOTE: TBD (CNES/TAS/Viveris)

The Jobs can be classified in different types depending on its purpose and types of actions that they aim at performing.

First of all, it has been highlighted the need of separation between Jobs related to administration tasks (herein called
admin), the Jobs related to the telecommunications domain which are the core of OpenBACH, and other job organised by project.

The admin Jobs shall be separated among generic administration, OpenBACH administration and the acquisition of administration
statistics, while the Telecommunication/networking Jobs shall be separated depending on the OSI layer they are related to.


=== Material aspects: Entities

The following section describes the deployment of OpenBACH in different entities. In particular, Figure 9 shows the architecture
and the components of the proposed design. An example of network topology where OpenBACH could be deployed is available at
the top-left corner of the figure. In such topology, the network entities are interconnected by means of heterogeneous physical
links (satellite, terrestrial, LTE, WiFi, etc.).

The scheme also shows the components of OpenBACH, the functions (and the associated functional blocks), the entities (servers,
work stations, etc.) where the components are deployed, and a management network (recommended but optional) allowing the
interaction between these components.

==== Types of entities
Five types of entities (identified as grey boxes in the figure) are defined in the <<img-entity_arch>> OpenBACH design: network
entities, user entity, controller entity, collector entity and auditorium entity.

*	A “network entity” is defined as any machine, server, or workstation, able of hosting a Linux OS (and possibly Windows OS in
further evolutions of OpenBACH) and an OpenBACH Agent component. Some examples of roles performed by these “network entities”
are: a user terminal, a server, a proxy, a gateway, a satellite terminal, a terrestrial base station.
*	A “controller entity” is defined as any machine, server, or workstation, able of hosting a Linux OS where the Controller is
deployed.
*	A “collector entity” is defined as any machine, server, or workstation, able of hosting a Linux OS where the Collector is deployed.
*	An “auditorium entity” is defined as any machine, server, or workstation, able of hosting a Linux OS where the different
frontends of the Auditorium are deployed.
*	Finally, the “user entity” is defined as any personal computer (or workstation) from which a user would be capable of supervising
and interacting with OpenBACH. This entity requires at least a shell terminal access and a web browser (Firefox or Chrome) for
accessing the OpenBACH interfaces.

For the sake of simplicity, the Collector, the Controller and the Auditorium might be deployed in the same entity.

[#img-entity_arch,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Architecture, components and interfaces of OpenBACH
image::entity_arch.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

====	Functional blocks per entity


Below, we list the functional blocks, types of storage and components for each considered entity that OpenBACH shall implement:

*	A « Network entity » shall have:
**	An Agent :
***	A Control-Agent
**	A Collecting agent
***	Jobs (deployed) and Instances of Jobs (running/scheduled)
***	A path towards an available data storage: it shall allow to locally store data/logs. It is useful for offline scenarios where
the network entity is not accessible during the tests (e.g.: when a management network is not available).

*	The « Collector entity »  shall have:
**	A Collector daemon for statistics and status information.
**	A Collector daemon for log messages
**	A data base for storing logs.
**	A data base for storing statistics/data.

*	A « Controller entity » shall have:
**	A backend (web server)
**	A daemon (openbach-conductor).
**	A data Storage managed by the backend for storing information related to the benchmark (available agents and entities information,
information of jobs available, status of Jobs instances, scenarios, etc).

*	An “Auditorium entity” shall have several frontends: one per type of display (configuration of benchmark, statistics display and
logs display). In particular:
**	A frontend of configuration (web interface)
**	A python scripts interface
**	A dashboard frontend for real-time statistics dashboard (web interface)
**	A dashboard frontend for real-time log messages (web interface)
**	A frontend for plotting offline and post-processed data (web interface).


*	A « User entity » shall dispose of:
**	A web browser (Chrome/Firefox) client to access the different available frontends, i.e.:
***	Configuration web interface
***	Real-time statistics
***	Logs/errors/status
***	Post-processing or offline statistics
**	Linux/Unix shell terminals for jobs/scenarios configuration (related to the Python script frontend).


==	Detailed conception
=== Detailed conception of the Auditorium
====	Configuration frontends

Herein, we describe the design of the configuration frontends, and in particular the available supervision functions allowing to
configure OpenBACH and the different jobs/scenarios. On the other hand, the design and requirements of the other OpenBACH frontend,
i.e. those aiming at displaying the statistics/data and the log messages, are detailed in section <<section_display>> (after the
description design of the Collector and the Agents). This order is preferable since it makes the comprehension of the chosen solution
easier as well as the provided requirements of the frontends.

By means of the configuration frontends, the user shall be able to ask for different types of information regarding Agents and Jobs,
in particular, the user shall be able to ask for:

*	the list of Agents installed and their status (running/not running)
*	the list of Jobs that might be installed in an Agent (i.e. available for installation in OpenBACH). This might help a user decide
the jobs that can be installed.
*	the list of jobs available in each Agent (not necessarily running, only available)
*	the list of job instances  per Job that are scheduled/started for each Agent.
*	The scenarios available.
*	The list of scenario instances scheduled/started and their status.

This information is used by the user to have an update knowledge of the benchmark, so that he would be able to correctly perform
different tasks. The tasks that a user shall be able to carry out are:

*	Install/uninstall Agents in the network entities. The procedure for installing new Agents is explained in section <<install-agent>>
(TBD)  and in the wiki OpenBACH (http://opensand.org/support/wiki/doku.php?id=openbach:manuals:index).
*	Install/remove a job to/from an Agent
*	Schedule/start/stop a job instance in an Agent with different configuration parameters.
*	Create/delete/modify scenarios.
*	Start/stop a scenario instance over different Agents.
*	After the implementation of a new Job performed by a user, the user shall be able to make the Job available for installation.

The configuration frontend will thus serve as user interface, allowing the user to perform different tasks (as detailed above).
These tasks will be performed by calling the “openbach-functions” from the frontend in order to send the request to the core of
the Controller, also known as Backend, which will perform different actions according to the requested tasks. The benchmark shall
implement two different configuration frontends, one for basic users, which will perform different tasks through the web interface,
and a second frontend, based on python scripts, allowing for more flexibility and implemented for advanced users.

In order to maximize the evolutivity and the clarity of the backend implementation, both frontends shall be able to call/use the
same functions implemented in the backend. For this reasons, we propose a backend based on web services.

The communication between the Backend and the configuration frontends shall be carried out via an HTTP Restful API.

All the responses of the backend shall be implemented in JSON format.

=====	Web interface (Basic user)
In this section, we list some of the requirements that the frontend shall implement.

The web interface dedicated to configuration of the benchmark shall:

*	Display the status of the registered network entities (with Agents) and the collector.
*	Display the available jobs per Agent and their status.
*	Be able to configure, launch/schedule/stop the Jobs instances within a scenario.
*	Configure, display and launch/schedule/stop the available scenarios instances (by means of the openbach-function of the backend).
*	Be able to activate/deactivate/display the available statistics.
*	Be able to activate/deactivate/display the logs (and change the log level).

===== Python scripts (Advanced users)
NOTE: To modify

===	Detailed conception of Controller

The Controller is in charge of centralizing and deploying the configuration of OpenBACH, the Agents the Jobs and scenarios and
commands the Agents to schedule the Jobs instances to be launched within a scenario instance.

As it can be observed in <<img-controller_design>> (and previously detailed, see section <<section-func_blocks>>), the controller
shall implement different functional blocks. It mainly consists of a backend for controlling the main tasks and their configuration,
a daemon (openbach-conductor) to interact with the Agents and a data storage for saving information related to OpenBACH (status,
profiles, users, scenarios, etc.).

[#img-controller_design,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Controller design: Backend and interfaces
image::controller_design.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

====	Backend
The backend design shall follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern (as represented <<section-func_blocks>>) since
it allows a proper separation between the user-interface and the substance of the application.

In <<section-func_blocks>>, we can observe that a webserver (e.g. Apache or Nginx) shall be set up in front of the MVC pattern in
order to handle the user requests (from frontend) before passing those requests that require application logic.

The controller (of the MVC architecture) shall be in charge of receiving inputs and data from user and convert them to commands for
the views. The model shall be in charge of managing and accessing the database and the view shall contain the ways to set, compute
or manipulate information in order to send an output representation of required data.

In summary, the controller (of the MVC architecture) receives an action and data from the webserver (pushed by the user). It then
sends the data to the correct view (i.e. function), depending on the request. The view works with the model to get the appropriate
data under objects format and handles these objects in order to perform the required actions and create an output (response) to the user.

The views are the way to execute the “openbach-functions”, which are implemented in the openbach-conductor. Through these functions, the backend views shall be able to:
*	add/install (delete/remove) Agents and Jobs to/from the benchmark
*	list the available Agents and the available jobs per Agent.
*	create/modify/delete a scenario.
*	configure/launch/stop scenario instances.
*	List the available scenario and scenario instances and their status.
*	send commands of schedule/start/stop of Jobs instances to the corresponding Agents .
*	list the scheduled/started job instances and their status.

====	Ansible for communication Controller-Agent

The installation of an Agent or a Job requires the transmission of files (scripts, daemon files, configuration files, etc.), the
installation of dependencies (python, apt-get, software, etc.) and other needs such as the installation of a ntp client for
synchronizing the network entity. There are several off-the-shelf frameworks available in open-source allowing for application
deployment and/or configuration management (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, ...). The Ansible solution hasbeen retained because it is a
simple and flexible tool that gives you the ability to automate common tasks, deploy applications and launch commands in different
hosts from a centralized entity (in our case the OpenBACH Controller). In particular, Ansible implements the following features:

*	Ansible is open source and written in Python, which harmonizes with the philosophy of OpenBACH of implementing the Agent and the
Jobs in Python.
*	A scripting system based on YAML syntax, which is easily readable and with a very fast learning.
*	Everything is done via files called "playbook" (YAML syntax). The tasks written in the playbook call the Ansible modules (similar
to libraries) with different arguments (e.g. call the “apt-get” module with the option “build-dependencies” and the name of the package).
*	Ansible is only installed in the Controller. The distant hosts do not need any software requirements/dependencies to be controlled,
except for a SSH access (with the keys for authentication) and Python.
*	When playbook is executed, Ansible connects to the various entities to deploy configuration and start tasks. Thanks to the modules,
Ansible also ensures that any services that are supposed to work/run are correctly running, that a software is installed (e.g.
apt-get install packages), that a task has been performed (i.e. idempotent concept) and that all configuration files are up to date.
The last one is one of the strong points of Ansible.

====	Openbach-conductor
The Backend shall rely on a new functional item, a daemon identified as the openbach-conductor, allowing to:
* launch/manage/control complex scenario instances (over several Agent and with dependencies)
* implement a scheduler in the Controller because though the Agents control/schedule their own tasks, it is necessary also to schedule
the launch of Ansible playbooks (e.g. in case a distant network entity is only accessible at a specific time and not at the moment of
creating the test/scenario).
* avoid time out problems (associated to the webserver) when the time of execution of some playbooks are large (e.g, those installing
 Agents or dependencies, etc…). Thus the backend needs a background process (i.e. a daemon) capable of listening/controlling
 the local post-processing tasks without time constraints.

 It must be highlighted that though the Controller (openbach-conductor) shall be able to process itself some of the “openbach-functions” regarding
 information of Agents/Jobs (stored in its data storage), most “openbach-functions” need an action from the Agent side (configure/launch a Job
 instances, send updated information/status, etc.). For example, as explained latter, the Controller does not schedule the Job instances
 itself, instead, it commands the Agent to perform the scheduling of Jobs instances. The way the backend communicates to the Agents is discussed next.


The openbach-conductor shall be thus in charge of listening for commands from the views, building and launching the playbooks
(via SSH to communicate the commands and the tasks to be performed in the Agents).

The commands between the views and the openbach-conductor shall be sent via UNIX sockets.

Finally, it should be highlighted that the choice of Ansible does not add limitations or constraints to the OpenBACH design since it is
developed so that any other protocol/communication would replace Ansible for deploying/configuring OpenBACH with little effort (we do not
talk here about the installation of OpenBACH and its dependencies, where Ansible probes to be an asset).

====	MVC
===== MVC: data access

The model shall handle one database that belongs to the backend, to save user information, agents status (running or not), a jobs list per Agent,
job instances status, scenarios (and scenario instances) information and status, etc. Some of these information are potentially continuously modified
(i.e. job instances status). For updating the status information, the Controller shall implement an openbach-function (see next section) that when
requested (or recursively) sends status information from the Agent to the Collector (via the collecting functions of OpenBACH: i.e. stats and logs). The
Controller must recursively pull these status from the Collector to update its own database.

Finally, the backend database shall implement different user profile types (see section XX).

=====	MVC: openbach-functions views
The "openbach-functions views" (kind of an access to the openbach-functions) available in the Controller are implemented in the backend, but the real
implementation of the openbach-functions is available in the openbach-conductor. These functions are summarized in <<img-functions>> and detailed below
(the input JSON contents highlighted in bold are the required ones, the other ones are optional). They are classified in 6 main groups depending on
the object/component they concern to, i.e. the Agents, the Jobs, the Job instances, the scenarios or the scenario instances.

====	Justification of Djando framework
Django is an open-source Python web development framework.  First of all, it has been chosen since it is implemented in Python, which allows to harmonize
with the philosophy of OpenBACH (the Agent and the Jobs are developed in Python). Among the available Python frameworks, Django is known for offering
off-the-shelf functionalities (data access methods, optimized database structures, plugins for interfacing with different applications, profiles management,
etc.) allowing to focus on the pure development and the core functionalities required for the backend of OpenBACH.

Django is defined by their creator as a framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes
care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.


==	Detailed conception of Collector

As it has been previously presented in the overall design of OpenBACH, the Collector component shall be in charge of centralizing the collection of two main
groups of data: the statistics/data and the logs.

The Collector shall be able to receive and collect two types of stream messages: logs and stats/metrics. Each type of stream shall implement its own daemon
and its own database. The way OpenBACH collects the two types of data has been properly distinguished within the chain of functional blocks of <<img-gen_collector>>.

Both collections shall have the same functional scheme: a pure collector represented by a daemon that listens for new messages sent by the Agents, and a
proper data base with efficient search mechanisms an access features, where the daemon stores the statistics and logs.

The fact of differentiating between two different streams (and databases), one for logs and another one for stats, is necessary since the nature and the
format of each one is very different. For example, logs need a database capable of efficiently indexing and filtering long messages depending on host/job/type/etc,
while stats need a high precision when time stamping and storing the data.

[#img-gen_collector,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Generic functions of the Collector and interfaces
image::generic_collector.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

Regarding the interfaces of communications: the Collector daemon shall listen on a UDP/TCP socket, where all the Agents transmit their respective messages.
The daemon shall store the data into a local data base via an HTTP API. Any external access to the data base (e.g. visualize the data in a web interfaces)
shall be performed by means of this HTTP API.

The data received can be flagged. The flag can precise if the data should:

* be stored in the database
* and/or broadcasted to the Auditorium. The broadcast is done on an TCP or UDP socket (configurable) on the port 2223.

.Flag of stats
[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|===
| Stored in DB | Broadcasted	     | Flag Value
|  no          | no                | 0
|  yes         | no                | 1
|  no          | yes               | 2
|  yes         | yes               | 3
|===

As detailed in the following two sections, off-the-shelf open-source software solutions have been chosen for fulfilling the needs of OpenBACH, and in order to
have a robust collecting system at the disposal of OpenBACH. Moreover, this choice allows to focus more effort on the design and the development of an evolutive
and robust configuration/control function (one of the critical points of this benchmark).

===	Logs collection details
Concerning the logs, the collector daemon function is performed by Logstash and the database role is carried out by Elasticsearch.

Logstash is an open-source data collection (under Apache 2 license), and a data transportation pipeline. It allows to efficiently process a growing list of logs, events and unstructured data sources for distribution into a variety of outputs, including the one used herein, an Elasticsearch data base. It is capable of normalizing different data formats by means filters.

Thus, once Logstash collects a log, it sends it to ElasticSearch, a database developed by the same creators of Logstash. The main features of Elasticsearch are:
•	It has an indexing engine allowing fast search of data.
•	Real-time analytics of the stored data
•	It is API driven by a simple Restful API using JSON over HTTP. Log search is performed by this means.
•	The requests/queries are returned in common text formats like JSON.
•	It is available under Apache 2 open-source license.


Below, it is shown an example of the way logs can be exported from ElasticSearch via the HTTP API (check Elasticsearch manuals for more information). In the example, two filters are used for:
•	exporting the logs within a 10 seconds time range, and
•	returning only log-type-one logs lines

}

===	Statistics collection details

In the case of the statistics collection, we take profit of InfluxDB as a database, an open-source platform for data collection and storage. We use Logstash here too as the collecting daemon. Logstash is capable of listening on a UDP/TCP socket from the Agents messages (on the port 2222), and redirects the collected data to InfluxDB using an HTTP API. Otherwise, the Agent would have had to insert the data directly into the database (via HTTP), which would have made the Agents dependant on the type of database.

InfluxDB is capable of handling data time series with high precision (1ms if necessary) when the constraints of performance and availability are strong.

The external access to the InfluxDB data storage is also realized by means of this HTTP API. InfluxDB comes with a web HMI allowing to visualize or add raw data for advanced users.

Below, it is shown an example of writing and querying formats to be used when interacting with InfluxDB database via the HTTP API (check InfluxDB manuals for more information):

*	Writing data: a POST shall be sent to the database (e.g. name mydb). The data consists of the measurement “cpu_load_short”, the tag keys host and region with the tag values “server01” and “us-west”, the field key value with a field value of “0.64”, and the Unix Timestamp  “1434055562000000000”.
[source,json]
----
curl -i -XPOST 'http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb' --data-binary 'cpu_load_short,host=server01,region=us-west value=0.64 1434055562000000000'
----

* Querying data: to perform a query, a GET request shall be sent. It shall set the URL parameter “db” as the target database, and set the URL parameter “q” as your query. The example allows to query the same data was written in the POST example.
[source,json]
----
curl -G 'http://localhost:8086/query?pretty=true' --data-urlencode "db=mydb" --data-urlencode "q=SELECT value FROM cpu_load_short WHERE region='us-west'"
----

InfluxDB is released under the open-source MIT License.


==	Detailed conception of Agent

The Agent component shall implement two main parts according to the main functionalities of OpenBACH, a Control-Agent for configuring and controlling
the Agent, and the Collect-Agent for everything related to statistics and logs collection. These two main parts are represented in <<img-agent_design>>. as the
two grey boxes.

A reliable communication protocol shall be used to receive the commands and configuration from the Controller. As it has been previously
explained, the chosen protocol is SSH. Represented as a red box in <<img-agent_design>>, we can observe the virtual SSH connection created and managed by
Ansible (from the Controller). This methodology shall be also used to modify the configuration of log severity level and the activation/deactivation
of statistics.

The Control-Agent shall be in charge of scheduling, executing, checking and stopping the Jobs instances (green box) available in the network entity.
As it has been previously defined, a job can be defined as a number of individual tasks, i.e. start a traffic generator, start collecting a new
data/statistics, start a service, etc.

[#img-agent_design,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Detailed design of OpenBACH Agent including its interfaces
image::agent_design.png[align="center"]
{nbsp} +

===	The Control-Agent part

The Control-Agent shall implement:
* A daemon for centralizing the tasks/jobs control (“openbach-agent” in <<img-agent_design>>),
* a generic small bash script (“openbach-baton” in <<img-agent_design>>) that the Controller uses to communicate with the daemon, and
* a scheduler (integrated in the daemon “openbach-agent” and based on the Python library “apscheduler”) for launching/scheduling the tasks of the daemon.

The communication shall be performed as follows:

* Step 1 (already seen in the Controller design): Depending on the “openbach-function” called in the Backend, the openbach-conductor (in the Controller)
builds a playbook and creates an SSH connection with the Agent by means of Ansible. The playbook consist of a simple command allowing to execute the
“openbach-baton” with a set of parameters (see an example at the end of this section XXX).

* Step 2: The playbook executes the ”openbach-baton” script with the set of required parameters.

* Step 3: “openbach-baton” forwards the order to the daemon (“openbach-agent”) by means of a local socket.

* Step 4: The daemon “openbach-agent” registers the received command and executes its tasks/actions (known as “agent-actions”). These actions are related to the
“openbach-functions” implemented in the Controller-Backend as it is detailed next.

NOTE: Justification for the need of “openbach-baton”: The shell script “openbach-baton” is only a tool to transmit the order/command from the Controller
to the Agent. It is needed because Ansible, which is the mean of communication between the two components, needs not only a way to relay the commands to the
Agent but also to get a proper response from the Agent (i.e. a response that Ansible would be able to interpret, e.g. OK status). Moreover, the use of
“openbach-baton” would allow to replace the communication mechanisms if wanted (for example, introducing a communication between web services for sending
some commands instead of Ansible.)

The use of bash for this relay seems a reliable way of interfacing the entities.

Below, the main features of the Agent are described:
* The Agent shall be based on a request-to-do policy, i.e. it shall perform tasks only when the Controller asks for.
* Within the command, the Agent may receive start/stop date-time information from the Controller, so that it will know when to execute the “agent-function”
associated to.
* Depending on the command type, other options can be used as described below.
* The Agent shall manage the scheduler locally, so that it will be able to control the whole execution/status of the agent-actions.
* The Agent scheduler shall be able to execute the agent-actions with one millisecond accuracy.

=====	Agent actions
The agent-actions are a group of actions implemented in the "openbach-agent" that allow performing different tasks regarding the OpenBACH control. These actions
are directly related to the “openbach-functions”, since as it has been explained, in some cases, these functions need to perform actions/tasks in the Agents
side (groups 3 and 4 shown in <<img-functions>>), and the agent-actions are their way to do it.

Table 4 shows the mapping between the openbach-function of the backend, the openbach-baton commands (commands sent via Ansible) and the agent actions
implemented in the Agent.
